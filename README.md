kaggle_medical_cost

I wanted to model this dataset to demonstrate my data science skills. I created multiple models and demonstrated feature similarity between models with a decent optimized model producing low RSME and high R^2 values.  

The dataset came from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nanditapore/medical-cost-dataset?datasetId=3643147

The notebook here will also be uploaded to Kaggle.

Happy hunting.
